    "## Azure Document Intelligence and Computer Vision Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure Document Intelligence, part of Azure's AI services, leverages advanced machine learning and computer vision technologies, including **LayoutLMv3**, the most cutting-edge document AI model, to analyze and extract information from a variety of documents, such as invoices, receipts, and tax forms. LayoutLMv3 is designed to understand both the text and layout of documents, making it highly effective at capturing complex document structures and relationships between text elements. This model enables Azure Document Intelligence to automate the tedious process of manually reviewing and entering data into structured formats, identifying key fields, extracting text, and recognizing entities within complex documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer vision is a broader field of artificial intelligence that allows machines to interpret and understand visual inputs such as images or scanned documents. In the context of document intelligence, computer vision helps systems \"read\" documents, recognize patterns, and extract meaningful information from unstructured or semi-structured data sources, making it an essential tool for automating tasks such as document processing, compliance, and auditing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we use Azure Document Intelligence to analyze and extract data from tax-related documents, automating the process of identifying document types and extracting relevant fields like wages, taxes, and filing statuses. Azure Document Intelligence can be explored further at [documentintelligence.ai.azure.com](https://documentintelligence.ai.azure.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a breakdown of the steps we follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Installing Required Packages**  \n",
    "   We begin by installing the necessary packages, including `azure-ai-documentintelligence` and `xlsxwriter`, which are essential for document analysis and exporting the results to Excel.\n",
